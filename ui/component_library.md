# UI Component Library

## Component Inventory
- **BaseButton** — primary action button with prominence and hover states.
- **SurfaceCard** — elevated container for key summaries.
- **StatusChip** — compact status indicator for Clean/Dirty states.

## Usage Guidelines
- Use **BaseButton** for the primary call-to-action per screen.
- Combine **SurfaceCard** and **StatusChip** to emphasise gated approvals.
- Respect spacing tokens (`spacing.md`) between stacked components.
